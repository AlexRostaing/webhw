			<h1>The Internet</h1>
				<div class="intro">
					<p>The <b>internet</b> is a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.
					Which should not be confused with the World Wide Web, a.k.a the web. The <b>WWW</b> is an information system on the Internet which allows documents to be connected to other documents by hypertext links, enabling the user to search for information by moving from one document to another.

			<h2>How I use the internet</h2>
				<div class="wutilike">
					<p>There are two reasons why i use the internet, for information and for entertainment. Firstly, I gather information for work and for personal curiosity and interest. As a computer scientist, there is always a need for detailled and precise information on coding laguanges, protocols and operating systems. 
					As such, the internet gives remote access to documentation and specifications instead of requiring a physical or digital copy. Furthermmore, these documents are often updated and would otherwise require to reprint/download the new version.
					As for personal interest, the multitude of information (scientific, journalistic, etc.) shared on the internet enables the broadning of knowledge and perspective. Although it requires caution as not all sources are trustworthy.
					Secondly, I use the internet for entertainment purposses. This includes watching videos, movies and tv shows, playing online video games, reading online comics and novels, and developing my hobbies (i.e. programming).
